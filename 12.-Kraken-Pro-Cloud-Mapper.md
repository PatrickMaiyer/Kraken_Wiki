# Kraken Pro Cloud Alpha Note

This software is in ALPHA status. That means that all the intended features are not yet implemented, and that it may have multiple bugs. We also do not guarantee any uptime for this service at this time.

[Kraken Pro Cloud](https://map.krakenrf.com) is our online cloud mapping solution for KrakenSDR devices. It allows you to upload KrakenSDR direction finding data onto our central server, so that you can combine bearing data from multiple geographically distributed KrakenSDR devices. With the right geography of the receivers and transmitter, this allows you to instantly determine the location of a transmitter without needing to take multiple readings with a vehicle.

## Geography and Positioning

At least two and ideally three or more KrakenSDRs spread out over some distance will be required. If you are detecting transmitters far away, the receivers will need to be spread out more in order to get good crossing of the bearings.

# Software

Kraken Pro Cloud can be accessed by browsing to https://map.krakenrf.com. In order to sign up you will need to enter your email address, and have the serial number of any KrakenSDR that you own. This is the 8-digit number printed under the CE/FCC/UKCA/NoBinning logos on the front-right of the device.

Once logged in your will be presented with a map and control sidebar.
