## VirtualBox

We currently have a [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) virtual machine image that is in beta. The image is based on Ubuntu 22.04 and has the KrakenSDR Direction Finding, KrakenSDR Passive Radar, and GNU Radio with KrakenSDR Source block preinstalled.

The image is provided as an OVA file, so in VirtualBox go to File->Import to use it. Make sure you deselect the network interface upon install, and then before starting set networking to bridged mode, and select your own network interface on your host.

Note that this uses the VirtualBox USB3.0 implementation as we have found that the USB2.0 implementation is too slow and drops samples. The USB3.0 implementation works well. In order to use the USB3.0 implementation you will need the Oracle VM VirtualBox Extension Pack from https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads installed to your VirtualBox.

We recommend allocating 8GB of RAM and 4 CPU cores to the system. We have tested the image on a 6th gen and 11th gen intel CPU. The 6th gen runs the DOA software well and PR software well but not at full speed. The GNU Radio code struggles to keep up on 6th gen. The 11th gen is capable of handling everything.

**Linux Hosts NOTE:** Note that on Linux hosts you will need to run the following command first, in order to allow for USB pass through to work.

```
sudo adduser $USER vboxusers
```
## Docker

Third parties have created a Docker container that you can use for installing a ready to use image of the DOA software. Note that the Docker container will not work on Windows, due Docker not supporting USB passthrough from Windows to a Linux image. Also note that the Docker container is immutable, so any settings changes you save will not persist once the image is restarted.
