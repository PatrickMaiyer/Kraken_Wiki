# Caring and protecting your KrakenSDR

## Nearby Transmitters
The KrakenSDR is a sensitive radio receiver. Like most radio receivers, any antennas connected to the KrakenSDR MUST be kept away from powerful nearby RF transmitters. 

The maximum input power allowed at the SMA receiver ports is +10dBm. Please ensure external measures like filtering, switching or physical placement are in place to block or limit RF power to the SDR if you know that you will be operating close by to a powerful transmitter.

## Lightning and ESD Damage
For protection, the KrakenSDR implements an ESD diode, gas discharge tube, and diode power clipper. 
However, it will not withstand direct or induced electrical surges from nearby lightning events, or huge electrostatic discharge (ESD) events that are possible from events like snow and dust storms.

Therefore, we suggest that any outdoor connected antenna MUST have externally provided lightning and ESD protection measures in place.

## Operating Environment
The KrakenSDR has been tested to operate normally in ambient environments of up to 50C. However, for longevity it is recommended to keep it in a cool environment, and out of direct sunlight.

# Safety and Environment

Before getting started with your KrakenSDR, please review these safety instructions.

**Electrical shock:** You could be INJURED OR KILLED if live electrical wires touch an antenna that is connected to a KrakenSDR. When dealing with external antennas, always ensure that your antennas are kept well away from power lines and any other live electrical wires.

**EM leakage:** The KrakenSDR CANNOT TRANSMIT RF, however, it does contain a built-in internal wideband noise source that is used for phase calibration purposes. Although this noise source is low power, isolated from the antennas via a high isolation silicon switch and enclosed within a metal faraday cage, there could be small amounts of wideband EM noise leakage that could interfere with highly sensitive radio equipment. This leakage has been measured to be well below regulatory compliance thresholds. However, should you open or remove the enclosure or make any modifications to the unit for any reason, noise source leakage may increase beyond compliance thresholds.

**Enclosure temperature:** The KrakenSDR metal enclosure may become warm or hot to the touch during operation. The KrakenSDR should be kept out of direct sunlight and placed in a ventilated space.

**Cooling fan blades:** The KrakenSDR contains a cooling fan on the enclosure that operates at high RPM. A finger guard is fitted, however small fingers and debris could get into the fan blades. Please take care when handling an operating unit, and always ensure the fan area is clear of debris before powering on the device.

**Driving risks:** A typical use-case for the KrakenSDR may be using it in a motor vehicle for radio direction finding. Please, always pay attention to the road when using the device in a vehicle and only have a passenger operate the KrakenSDR and perform all navigation tasks. Always ensure the antennas on the roof of your vehicle are attached securely and comply with all local road laws.

**Compliance with Law:** It is the sole responsibility of the KrakenSDR owner / user to comply with all laws that apply in their jurisdiction. Specifically, around any licence fees applicable to receivers, information that can be legally extracted from the RF environment, making RF environment observations public, or not using the KrakenSDR for any illegal purpose.  This may include information gained from the remote operation from the KrakenSDR.

**Regions of conflict/war or use in sensitive locations:** You may be risking your life, or arrest, when using any sort of radio receiver in regions of conflict/war or in sensitive locations. Please consider your need to use the KrakenSDR very carefully in these areas.

# Recycling

The KrakenSDR is compliant with RoHs. However, as the KrakenSDR contains a PCB and electronic components, please do not dispose of it in the household trash. Should you need to dispose of a KrakenSDR, please take it to an e-waste recycling plant, or ship it back to KrakenRF Inc. Our details can be found at krakenrf.com.

# Warranty
The KrakenSDR has a one-year warranty from manufacturing defects.
Please keep in mind the warranty will not cover damage from external events such as lightning or ESD, fire, over voltage, flooding, physical damage, or modifications.
